Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
You've changed since you met me and I feel I've done the same
Our friends, they all notice and your siblings think it's strange
That I wanna be with you every single day
For the rest of our lives
I can't help but feel guilty when I'm taking up your time
So I'll take out my old notebook and I'll put this and write
Oh, I wanna be with you every single day
For the rest of our lives
Someday I'll make a home with you
It may be big, it may be small
We'll make a space where all the kids can run around and safely fall
But if the dreams don't happen right away, that's okay
I just wanna be with you every single day
For the rest of our lives
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You've changed since you met me and I feel I've done the same
But I've changed for the better, and you're the one to blame
That's why I wanna be with you every single day
We've had our share of sorrows and pain that keeps us up at night
Sometimes I wish we'd stand down instead of putting up a fight
But still I wanna be with you every single day
'Til the day that we die
Someday I'll take you 'round the world
And visit places where you stayed
I'll place some shows on radios, listen close, I'll sing your name
But if the dreams don't happen right away, that's okay
I just wanna be with you every single day
For the rest of our lives
I'm gonna work on my temper
While you learn to speak your mind some more
I'll be more of a shelter and less of a storm
While we both are working on ourselves in our own ways
I just wanna be with you every single day
Oh, I wanna be with you every single day
For the rest of our lives
for the rest of our lives
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh) 'til the day that we die

That's why I wanna be with you every single day
We've had our share of sorrows and pain that keeps us up at night
Sometimes I wish we'd stand down instead of putting up a fight
But still I wanna be with you every single day
'Til the day that we die
Someday I'll take you 'round the world
And visit places where you stayed
I'll place some shows on radios, listen close, I'll sing your name
But if the dreams don't happen right away, that's okay
I just wanna be with you every single day
For the rest of our lives
I'm gonna work on my temper
While you learn to speak your mind some more
I'll be more of a shelter and less of a storm
While we both are working on ourselves in our own ways
I just wanna be with you every single day
Oh, I wanna be with you every single day
For the rest of our lives
for the rest of our lives
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh) 'til the day that we die

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
You've changed since you met me and I feel I've done the same
Our friends, they all notice and your siblings think it's strange
That I wanna be with you every single day
For the rest of our lives
I can't help but feel guilty when I'm taking up your time
So I'll take out my old notebook and I'll put this and write
Oh, I wanna be with you every single day
For the rest of our lives
Someday I'll make a home with you
It may be big, it may be small
We'll make a space where all the kids can run around and safely fall
But if the dreams don't happen right away, that's okay
I just wanna be with you every single day
For the rest of our lives
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You've changed since you met me and I feel I've done the same
But I've changed for the better, and you're the one to blame
That's why I wanna be with you every single day
We've had our share of sorrows and pain that keeps us up at night
Sometimes I wish we'd stand down instead of putting up a fight
But still I wanna be with you every single day
